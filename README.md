# postgresman 

An informal manual I refer to when hacking on the Postgres codebase.

## Table of Contents
### `workflow.md`
How to print variables to the shell, set up your codebase, and recompile your program.

### `patch.md`
Create and apply patches.

### `formatting.md`
Use `pg_bsd_indent` to format your commits. 



## Credit
I learned all of this from Joe Koshakow. So all credits to him. ðŸ™‡
